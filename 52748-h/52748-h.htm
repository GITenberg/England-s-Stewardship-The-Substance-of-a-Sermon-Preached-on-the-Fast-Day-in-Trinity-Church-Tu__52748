</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> no time in England&rsquo;s
history has she been called to humble herself before God under
more harrowing circumstances than the present.&nbsp; We have not
to deplore the discomfiture of our armies, or the hardships of
our soldiers,&mdash;not the privations on the heights of
Sebastopol, or the deadly conflicts of Balaklava and the
Redan,&mdash;events which are, more or less, to be expected in a
soldier&rsquo;s life; but we are now summoned to prayer by the
cries of tortured infants, by the unutterable agonies of
heartbroken mothers, of daughters, sisters, and wives, who have
been called to endure outrages and witness scenes in comparison
of which it would have been a light matter to have been torn limb
from limb by the tigers of the jungle.&nbsp; Satan appears to
have been let loose in India, in all his deadly and corrupt
ferocity.&nbsp; There has been a kind of filling up of
God&rsquo;s four sore judgments.&nbsp; Famine, pestilence, and
war had already followed each other in quick succession; but we
thought we were free from noisome beasts.&nbsp; But now we have
something incomparably worse let loose on our <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>fellow-countrymen to fill the fair plains of India with
wailing, lamentation, and woe.</p>
<p>But it is not needful to recapitulate these tales of
horror.&nbsp; I am persuaded that I need not stand here to excite
your sympathy for the sufferers.&nbsp; You have felt that
already, and I trust that many an earnest cry has long ere this
gone up from your homes for India.&nbsp; If not, just think on
the little garrison at Lucknow, hemmed in by rebel thousands,
with provisions every day diminishing, with the massacre of
Cawnpore before their eyes, and with the horrid murderer at the
head of the blockading force thirsting for their blood, and
eager, if ever he can gain the power, to re-enact the same
barbarities on themselves.&nbsp; Think what those women must
endure, as the little stores are doled out day after day; and
they know that, unless they are relieved, they have no prospect
but the foulest massacre; and every heart must acknowledge that
the time is come, if it be not already past, for the universal
cry of wrestling prayer, and most earnest pleading with God on
their behalf.</p>
<p>But this is a day for humiliation as well as prayer, and
national judgments are so intimately connected with national
sins, that the nation&rsquo;s prayer should clearly be
accompanied by the nation&rsquo;s humiliation.&nbsp; It behoves
us, therefore, to consider what ground there is for such
humiliation, and what sins there are to call forth our repentance
and confession.&nbsp; But we need not in this inquiry occupy time
by the consideration of those sins which are more especially
connected with home, for the finger of God points to India.&nbsp;
It is there that the blow has fallen, and there that we must look
for <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>this
sin.&nbsp; It is clearly on Indian matters that God now has a
controversy with his people, and therefore our conduct with
reference to India should be the subject of especial
enquiry.&nbsp; Let us, then, examine, in the first place,
England&rsquo;s stewardship; and afterwards, England&rsquo;s
account of that stewardship.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; The Stewardship.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that England stands in a position of a
steward before God.&nbsp; We are all stewards of the various
talents and opportunities which we possess.&nbsp; The minister is
a steward of the mysteries of God, and I stand here myself this
very day as his steward, or servant, to declare his word.&nbsp;
The parent is a steward; and what a stewardship it is to be
entrusted with the training of immortal souls for the kingdom of
the Lord!&nbsp; The rich man is a steward; his property is not
his own, but he is entrusted with it in order that he may lay it
out for man&rsquo;s happiness and God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; On the
same principle, nations are entrusted with their various
stewardships.&nbsp; The Jewish nation, for example, was the
steward of Scripture: &ldquo;Unto them were committed the oracles
of God;&rdquo; and whatever be the particular power or privilege
of a nation, that power or privilege is a talent, or stewardship,
to be employed in the service of Him who gave it.</p>
<p>Now, if ever there was a case in which this stewardship was
conspicuous, it is in England&rsquo;s relationship to
India.&nbsp; It was placed in our hands by God himself.&nbsp;
When our merchants first settled on the banks of the Hooghly,
there was no thought of territorial possession.&nbsp; In their
first acquisitions of property they were influenced <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>merely by
motives of self-defence.&nbsp; They were compelled to occupy
districts surrounding them, in order to protect themselves from
aggression.&nbsp; I fear that the same cannot be said of our more
recent annexations; but it was most unquestionably the case when
India was first placed in our hands.&nbsp; Our first merchants
had no thought of a kingdom, but the providence of God gave it
us.</p>
<p>Look, again, at the wonderful power with which that vast
empire has been held.&nbsp; Look at the two countries on the
map&mdash;the one a little island on the western ocean, and the
other a vast territory 15,000 miles distant, extending thousands
of miles in every direction, and supporting a population of not
less than 160,000,000 souls.&nbsp; Remember, again, that India
contains many large, powerful, and warlike nations, and you will
see that there must have been a power far beyond the hand of man
which has enabled a little handful of Englishmen to hold under
control so large a proportion of the inhabited world.&nbsp; As
the Lord gave the stewardship, so the Lord has likewise preserved
the power.</p>
<p>But look again at the religious condition of the two
countries; one, being the centre of Asiatic idolatry, with its
vast population sunk in idolatrous worship, and degraded by the
most soul-abasing superstitions, while the other has been the
centre of Christian light, with a greater amount of Christian
truth, and greater opportunities for its spread than any other
nation in the world.&nbsp; Is there not enough in this to teach
us the character and purport of our stewardship?&nbsp; Idolatrous
India is placed under the government of professedly <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Christian
England.&nbsp; This vast mass of heathen darkness is brought into
direct contact with the clearest light to be found in
Christendom, and is it too much to conclude that the stewardship
was a Christian stewardship, and that the great purpose for which
it was entrusted to our care was that the scriptural light of
England might be freely communicated, and shed its beams in the
midst of the deep darkness of Indian heathenism?</p>
<p>And is it not again most remarkable that this trust was given
to Protestant England?&nbsp; There were other nations which
preceded us in India, but to us was the stewardship given.&nbsp;
It was entrusted to the care of no Romish people, of Spain, or
France, or Austria, for none of those nations had the great
qualification for the trust.&nbsp; Not holding the truth
themselves they were disqualified from the high commission.&nbsp;
In England there was the profession of Scriptural truth.&nbsp; In
England the light of the Reformation burnt steadier than in any
other nation.&nbsp; In England there was a larger circulation of
the Scriptures than in any country in the world, and therefore to
England was the great trust given.</p>
<p>Can there then be any doubt as to the real character of
England&rsquo;s stewardship?&nbsp; Can we suppose that such a
trust was given simply in order to enrich our merchants, or to
find employment for our sons?&nbsp; Can we believe that these
160,000,000 immortal heathens were placed under our care in order
that the wealth and luxury of the East might be transferred to
our little island? and that our merchant princes might return to
erect palaces, and spend their latter days in luxurious
ease?&nbsp; Was it not rather given in order that England&rsquo;s
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>light might
shine in India&rsquo;s darkness; that heathen Asia might have
Christianity presented to its view, and that the millions of that
vast empire might be brought under the blessing of a Christian
government, and favoured with that which is the highest gift
within the reach of man, the clear exhibition of Christian
truth?&nbsp; I believe it may be safely said, that throughout the
history of the world no nation was ever yet favoured with so
noble an opportunity, or intrusted with so high a
stewardship.&nbsp; We have had both light and power, and with
this double qualification in our hands we have had a vast empire
for a whole century placed under our care.&nbsp; No wonder then
that God now says to us at the close of the hundred years,
&ldquo;Give an account of thy stewardship.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; And now let us consider England&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>And here it is a joy to acknowledge that a vast amount of good
has been done for India, and that our rule has been productive of
great social and moral improvement.&nbsp; Roads have been made
and canals formed; justice has been administered to an extent
never known previously; Thuggism, Sutteeism, and child murder
have been abolished, and on the whole there has been a vast and
increasing amount of just and beneficial legislation.&nbsp; All
this we most freely and thankfully acknowledge.&nbsp; Why then,
it may be asked, is there need for humiliation?&nbsp; If so much
good has been done, what reason is there to be humbled for our
sin?</p>
<p>For the answer to this question, we must not merely consider
civil and social improvements, but we must consider the Christian
character of our trust, and I <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>fear it will be found, that instead of
holding it as a stewardship from God, we have treated India as if
it were our own, holding it in the pride of our own power, and
making use of it for the purpose of our own aggrandizement.</p>
<p>Consider some of the acts of <i>Government</i>, and in the
first place, the trade in opium.&nbsp; The use of this drug is of
comparatively recent date in China.&nbsp; In 1767, there were
only 200 chests imported there, whereas now there are above
60,000.&nbsp; And this has been done in defiance of the Chinese
Government.&nbsp; The opium used to be carried in fast vessels,
fully armed, so that our opium merchants were in fact armed
smugglers.&nbsp; The determination to force the trade on China,
was the simple cause of the former Chinese war.&nbsp; But the
Chinese Government has been utterly unable to contend against
British enterprise, and the result is that thousands and tens of
thousands are at the present time falling victims to the
scourge.&nbsp; You may see all along the coasts of China
innumerable cases of constitutions broken, intellects impaired,
hopes blasted, homes desolate, and whole families sunk into the
lowest state of degradation and distress, and all through the
opium which we Englishmen have supplied from India.</p>
<p>The effect is also most injurious in India itself.&nbsp; It is
stated that there are 100,000 acres of the finest land in Central
India, besides the alluvial valley of the Ganges, now devoted to
opium, which were once productive of sugar, indigo, corn, and
other grain for the sustenance of man.</p>
<p>And who are the parties to this great crime?&nbsp; If they <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>were simply
private individuals, it might be exceedingly difficult to check
the trade by legislation, and it might possibly be beyond the
power of Government to prevent it.&nbsp; But what are we to say
when the Government itself is the great offender?&nbsp; When,
instead of putting the smallest check on the traffic or the
growth, they interpose their mighty power, and claim to
themselves the sole monopoly of the trade.&nbsp; In this respect
the East India Company is a vast monopolist, and in order to
increase the profits of their monopoly, they adopt a system of
advances which forces the growth of the poppy on the ryots or
cultivators of the soil.&nbsp; Oh, who can wonder that God has
brought a scourge on India!</p>
<p>And why, it may be asked, is all this done?&nbsp; The question
has often been discussed, but I never heard more than one answer
given.&nbsp; There is no plea put forth of social
improvement.&nbsp; There is no pretence that any good is done
either to India or China.&nbsp; It is admitted that thousands of
acres of our best land are diverted from useful purposes.&nbsp;
It is admitted, for it cannot be denied, that the trade is
spreading death like the most fatal pestilence in China, and
there is but one argument put forth in defence of the
system.&nbsp; There is but one apology even offered.&nbsp; I know
it is a strong argument to some minds, and it seems to be strong
in the minds of the East Indian Government.&nbsp; That one
argument is, that it pays so well.&nbsp; It is said to bring in
about 5,000,000<i>l.</i>, a-year to the East India Company.&nbsp;
And this is a rapidly-increasing income.&nbsp; In 1836 it was
1,399,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; In 1850 it had grown to
3,309,637<i>l.</i>, and now it is said to have reached the large
sum of <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>5,000,000<i>l.</i> a-year.&nbsp; This is the one
argument for China&rsquo;s ruin, and is it strange that God has
smitten us in India?</p>
<p>But again we endeavoured to show, in the outset, that England
had a religious trust, being the steward of truth as well as
power.&nbsp; But the Indian Government, on the other hand, has
taken up the position of absolute neutrality between the Gospel
and the most foul idolatry.&nbsp; Indeed, so far has this gone,
that in some instances it might have been almost supposed that
they looked with a more favourable eye to idolatry than
Christianity.</p>
<p>For example.&nbsp; Until a very recent date the Government has
not merely maintained some idol temples, but paid the expense of
the idol worship, not merely paying the priests, but actually
going one step further, and providing the payments for the
abandoned females who are connected with the idolatrous
rites.&nbsp; Such honour has the Indian Government paid to
idolatry, that British troops have been ordered out, under
British and Christian officers, to fire salutes in honour of foul
and filthy idols, such as Juggernaut.&nbsp; Nor has this
deference to idolatry even yet altogether ceased, for to this
very day the filth and obscenity of idolatry is spared, while
decency is enforced in other quarters.&nbsp; There was a law
passed not long since against obscene paintings and publications,
but there was this clause inserted, &ldquo;Nothing contained in
this Act shall apply to any representation sculptured, engraved,
or painted on, or in, any temple, or on any car used for the
conveyance of idols.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that even public decency has
been set aside out of respectful deference to an obscene and
filthy idol.&nbsp; Oh! brethren, have we not reaped what <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>we have sown
in the late most awful outbreak of abominable and polluting
passion?</p>
<p>But much has been done in India in the way of
<i>education</i>.&nbsp; Large schools have been established at
the expense of Government, and a great effort has been made to
elevate the standard of intellect amongst the natives.&nbsp; But
here again there has been the same fatal principle of
indifference, I cannot say of neutrality in religious
matters.&nbsp; The education given in those schools has been
secular not Christian.&nbsp; There have been many books read and
taught there.&nbsp; The Koran has been studied there.&nbsp; The
Hindoo Shastres may have been seen on the table, English
literature of all kinds is taught in the classes.&nbsp; There you
may find Bacon, and Milton, and Gibbon, and Shakspeare, and other
great authors that adorn our own libraries; but there has been
one book till very recently excluded, one book that even now you
can merely find on the shelf, while the Koran and the Shastres
are on the table; one solitary book on which is placed the ban of
the East Indian Government, and that one book is the Bible, the
only book that has come direct from God; the only book that
claims, by its divine authorship, the universal study and
obedience of mankind.&nbsp; Who can be surprised, then, if the
pupils in those schools grow up without scriptural
principles?&nbsp; And are we not reaping the fruit of our own
seed when such a wretch as Nena Sahib, who is reported to have
been one of the pupils in these very schools, teaches us, by his
foul acts, the awful atrocities of which educated human nature,
without the grace of God, is capable.</p>
<p>And now for <i>missions</i>.&nbsp; And here we are met by the
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>fact that
for the first fifty-six years of our century of power a
missionary, as a missionary, was not allowed to set his foot on
British soil.&nbsp; It is true that some of the chaplains, such
as Martyn, Buchanan, and others, went out in a missionary spirit,
and though their duty was to attend to the Europeans, they went
beyond it, as volunteers in efforts among the heathen; but it was
not until the renewal of the Company&rsquo;s charter in 1813;
that missionaries, as missionaries, were allowed to land in
British India.&nbsp; Before that date several had actually been
sent away by the authorities of Calcutta, and in order to pursue
their labours, were compelled to take refuge under heathen
governments.&nbsp; So completely did we forget our stewardship
that, for more than half the time we have held it, we did not
even allow God&rsquo;s missionaries to attempt their work among
the millions committed to our charge.</p>
<p>But our treatment of the <i>Sepoys</i> has been worse
still.&nbsp; In them we have had a body of men entirely under our
orders, separated very much from the rest of society, living in
lines completely under our own control.&nbsp; Now, what has been
the case with them?&nbsp; I believe it is an admitted fact that
no missionary work has been permitted amongst them.&nbsp; The
gentleman who was here a short time ago for the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel stated that he had laboured for more
than twenty years in the neighbourhood of military cantonments,
but had never been allowed to labour among the Sepoys.&nbsp; Who
can wonder, in such a case, that those Sepoys are utterly
ignorant of the true character of Christianity, and are therefore
ready to believe that the use of a greased cartridge could make
them Christians?</p>
<p>But more than this.&nbsp; There has been in our treatment <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of these
Sepoys the most complete departure from even our boasted
principles of neutrality; for, although it seems a strong
statement, I believe it to be a true one, that in many eases
idolatry has been encouraged in these regiments, while
Christianity was dishonoured, if not put down.&nbsp; If a Brahmin
raised objections on the ground of his idols or his caste, he was
humoured in his folly, and regimental discipline was set aside in
his favour.&nbsp; But if a Christian spoke of conscience, and if
he objected on Christian grounds to fire a salute to some horrid
idol, in former days he was cashiered.&nbsp; The Brahmin&rsquo;s
folly was respected, the Christian&rsquo;s conscience
outraged.&nbsp; But in one case it went further, for in 1819
there was a devoted chaplain labouring at Meerut of the name of
Fisher, when a Sepoy who had been for years inquiring, applied to
him for baptism, and was baptized.&nbsp; The man was highly
respected in his regiment, a fine soldier, bearing the best of
characters.&nbsp; But the fact of his baptism was reported to the
Governor-General: and, to the shame of our Indian Government be
it spoken; to the lasting shame of all that had a hand in that
guilty act,&mdash;without any fault being laid to his charge, on
the contrary, with the highest testimony being borne to his
character, for the one act of becoming a Christian, that Sepoy
was dismissed the Service.&nbsp; Verily it seems as though that
guilty act had been hid in the soil of Meerut as the seed of the
present mutiny.&nbsp; There it was that a professedly Christian
Government cast its Christianity out of a Sepoy regiment, and
there, on that very spot, did the Sepoys shed the first Christian
blood, in their efforts to cast us out of India.</p>
<p>And now, it may be asked, why has all this been <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>done? and
what can have been the motive for this unchristian policy?&nbsp;
It has not been the love of Hindooism, for no one supposes for a
moment that any of India&rsquo;s rulers cared for it.&nbsp; But
it seems to have been the result of a false expediency and a
timid policy.&nbsp; The one defence that has been constantly put
forth has been that we must not endanger British power by
offending heathen prejudices.&nbsp; It has been thought that the
open and honest avowal of our Christianity might alarm the
advocates of idolatry, and so endanger English rule.</p>
<p>Now, I believe that nothing can be more fallacious than such
an opinion.&nbsp; No man ever yet gained anything in the long run
by holding back his principles.&nbsp; He may patch up a
difficulty for a time, but it will tell upon him with increased
power afterwards, and then he will have to meet it, distrusted by
his fellow men, and forsaken by God himself.&nbsp; Oh! brethren,
if you ever wish man to trust you, be honest to your own
principles, and remember the words of Scripture, &ldquo;Them that
honour me I will honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth of this has been abundantly proved in India, and
there are many facts to show that, as elsewhere, so in India, the
open avowal of our Christian principles has been the surest means
of obtaining the confidence of the natives.&nbsp; For example,
our Mission schools have been established on Christian
principles.&nbsp; In them there has been the Bible, but no
Shastres, and the Gospel, but no Koran; and it is a most
remarkable fact, and one that surely teaches a lesson of deep
import, that, although the Government schools have had all the
advantages of the support and patronage of the State, <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the people,
the heathen people, mark! have preferred the schools where Christ
was honoured, and have sent so many more children to them than to
the others, that the Government have at length been induced by
the demonstrated fact of their superior popularity, to admit them
to the advantages of a grant in aid.</p>
<p>Again, at this present time the gentleman acting in the
Commissariat department for the little force at Benares, is a
missionary of the Church Missionary Society.&nbsp; He has been
requested to leave the missionary compound, and go into the
cantonments, in order to make the necessary purchases for the
force.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because the people of the country
trust him as they do no one else, and he can make purchases when
others fail.&nbsp; Here is a man that has been never seen but
with the Bible in his hand and the Gospel on his lips; a man who
has attacked Hindooism openly, in the streets and in the bazaars,
and he is the man best trusted by the native population.&nbsp;
Can there be a more conclusive proof of the utter absurdity of
the foolish clamour that missions have stirred up the mutiny?</p>
<p>But there is another fact of the same kind.&nbsp; The Church
Missionary Society has a small mission at Bhagulpur, on the
borders of the Santal tribes, and when, in the late Santal
rebellion, those tribes came sweeping over the plains, that
little spot was preserved, like Gideon&rsquo;s fleece, moist,
when all around was dry, and dry when all around was moist with
blood.&nbsp; The influence of the Mission over these people was
so strong, and the tranquillizing power so clearly proved, that
the East Indian Government, to their great credit be it spoken,
have admitted the fact, and in order to <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>keep the
district quiet have actually requested the missionary of
Bhagulpur to organize similar missions at Government expense
throughout the Santal tribes.</p>
<p>Who can doubt, then, the fallacy of the idea, that a plain,
honest, and affectionate avowal of Christian principle would ever
have weakened British power?&nbsp; But even if it were
otherwise&mdash;if there were risk in introducing the Gospel and
in fulfilling our Stewardship&mdash;suppose there were the
deliberate choice between British sovereignty and the Kingdom of
our Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;suppose it to have been a fact that
there was danger to our rule in India if we openly avowed our
faith in Jesus&mdash;suppose that there were real risk in a
plain, open, honest, Christian government, what, brethren, should
have been the decision?&nbsp; Dearly as we love the prosperity of
our land, thankfully as we recognise the many beneficial changes
that have been effected by British power, fervently as we hope
for still greater results when the present crisis has passed
away, yet if there were antagonism between all this and the
Lord&rsquo;s Kingdom, there must not be one moment&rsquo;s
hesitation as to the verdict of the Christian man.&nbsp; Christ
must be honoured at all costs; and God forbid that England ever
hold a sovereignty either purchased or maintained at the awful
price of the suppression of our principles or the keeping back of
God&rsquo;s truth!</p>
<p>Here lies, I believe, the root of this sad calamity.&nbsp; The
contrary has been in many cases our decision.&nbsp;
England&rsquo;s power has been preferred to the Lord&rsquo;s
kingdom.&nbsp; We have forgotten our Stewardship.&nbsp; We have
not held India by Him or for Him.&nbsp; We have relied on our own
arm, and have governed for our own <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>purposes.&nbsp; And now that arm has
failed us, and those purposes have been completely
frustrated.&nbsp; The reed has broken and pierced through the
hand that leaned on it.&nbsp; God has let us feel what we are in
our own strength; and who could be surprised if He were now to
say, &ldquo;Thou mayest be no longer steward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is danger in fixing our thoughts too much on
governments, for by so doing we are apt to lose sight of our
personal responsibility; whereas we ought to remember that the
Church of God has had its trust likewise, and that every
individual amongst us has been more or less connected with the
question.&nbsp; Consider, then, the stewardship of the
<i>Church</i>.</p>
<p>In the last century there was very little done for the spread
of the Gospel in India.&nbsp; There are a few remarkable names on
record such as Schwartz and Martyn, and a few institutions such
as the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, in connexion
with which Schwartz laboured.&nbsp; But it was not till the
beginning of this century that the missionary spirit sprang up
with any vigour in the Church.&nbsp; The first half of the
century was almost wholly lost.&nbsp; This might be explained
partly by the opposition of Government.&nbsp; But since the year
1813 there has been no such impediment.&nbsp; There has been a
great country with its teeming millions.&nbsp; There has been the
most perfect personal safety.&nbsp; The missionaries could travel
from north to south without a danger.&nbsp; There has been a
peaceable population ready to discuss, and regarding with respect
the British name.&nbsp; There has been, in short, for the last
forty-four years the noblest and most magnificent opportunity for
Christian Missions that the world has ever witnessed.&nbsp; There
has been a <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>vast opening before us, such as would have filled the
Apostle&rsquo;s mind with zeal and wonder.&nbsp; And now what
have we done?&nbsp; Let the Church of God give an account of her
stewardship!</p>
<p>We thankfully acknowledge that this stewardship has not been
altogether neglected.&nbsp; Great and well conducted missionary
institutions have been at work, and devoted men have been raised
up for the service.&nbsp; Nor has God left us without tokens of
his blessing.&nbsp; In 1853 the whole Bible had been translated
into ten languages, the New Testament into five others, and
separate Gospels into four more.&nbsp; There were also at that
time as many as 2,015 missionary schools established; and, as far
as could be calculated, there were then no less than 112,000
converts.&nbsp; We may, therefore, thank God most heartily for
what has been done; but still it is nothing in proportion to the
immensity of the demand.&nbsp; In that year the Church of God
throughout the world&mdash;English, Scotch, American, and
European, including all Dissenting bodies&mdash;supplied only 395
American or European labourers, not one for half a million of the
Indian population.&nbsp; I have not the means of ascertaining the
present total, but, as far as I can gather from the Reports, the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel is now maintaining
about forty-eight English clergymen in India, and the Church
Missionary Society about ninety English clergymen, with about
twenty English laymen.&nbsp; There are Germans and natives
employed in addition, but the total, 158, very nearly represents
the sum of England&rsquo;s contribution of her own sons to this
great work through these two Church of England Societies.&nbsp;
And now, if we <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>remember the eagerness with which parents seek for
appointments either civil or military, and the steady stream of
gallant young men that are every year going forth to
India&mdash;when we contrast the difficulty of obtaining a single
missionary with the eagerness to obtain a Company&rsquo;s
appointment, I fear that we must come to the conclusion that we
are not yet awake to the responsibilities of our Stewardship, and
not yet alive to the loud and solemn call with which the great
Head of the Church is summoning us to the honour of his sacred
service.</p>
<p>The same may be said with reference to funds.&nbsp; In 1853
the large sum of 190,000<i>l.</i> was contributed, of which no
less than 33,500<i>l.</i> was subscribed in India itself, leaving
156,500<i>l.</i> to be collected from the rest of the
world.&nbsp; I am again unable to give the statistics of other
bodies at the present time, but the two Societies already
mentioned appear to spend between them money collected in England
to the amount of only 76,834<i>l.</i>, of which 57,635<i>l.</i>
is spent by the Church Missionary Society, and 19,199<i>l.</i> by
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.&nbsp; There is
doubtless some that passes through other channels, in addition to
the large sums expended by other bodies of Christians.&nbsp; But
we may regard 80,000<i>l.</i> as a near approximation to the
whole sum now spent by the Church of England on Indian
Missions.&nbsp; Now just contrast this sum with the large
fortunes made in India, with the number of families altogether
maintained from India, and, above all, with the fact that the
Company is deriving a net profit of 5,000,000<i>l.</i> a-year
from the opium traffic alone, and there is, I fear, most
overwhelming evidence that <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>we have utterly failed in our
Stewardship; that we have received much, but given little; that
we have been entrusted with great wealth and great opportunities,
but have made a most poor and pitiful return, having been content
to grow rich on India&rsquo;s produce without fulfilling our
sacred trust, or employing even a decent proportion of the income
derived from India on the evangelization of her people.</p>
<p>And the result of this defective liberality is evident in the
total spiritual destitution of vast districts, more especially
amongst those which have been the scenes of the present
outbreak.</p>
<p>Let us examine the state of some of these districts, now too
well known by the sad events that have happened there.</p>
<p>In a district around Agra, containing a population of
3,500,000, there were in 1852 nineteen missionaries; and around
Benares, for a population of 7,100,000, nineteen
missionaries&mdash;a tolerable supply, it may be thought, but yet
very little, when you reflect that around Benares there was
little more than one man to nearly 400,000 heathen.&nbsp; But
look at other cases.&nbsp; Take the case of Cawnpore, that place
whose name should be written in tears.&nbsp; Around Cawnpore
there is a district containing 3,200,000 persons, for which in
1852 there were only seven missionaries, one for nearly half a
million.&nbsp; Around Meerut there is a district containing
3,300,000, for which there were four missionaries.&nbsp; Around
Bareilly, a population of 4,400,000, for which there was not
one.&nbsp; Around Delhi, a population of 1,500,000, and not one,
although a Mission has since been established by the Society for
the Propagation of <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>the Gospel and another by the Baptists.&nbsp; But up to
the year 1853 there was not one.&nbsp; And so again at
Lucknow.&nbsp; The Government has for years been friendly to us,
the whole kingdom of Oude has been open to us, and for the last
two years it has been under our own dominion.&nbsp; But up to
this day I believe I am correct in stating that not a single
missionary has ever yet crossed its border.&nbsp; Such is the
spiritual condition of vast regions in India at the present
time.&nbsp; According to the language of an able writer,
&ldquo;Some of the finest and most populous parts of the country
are altogether neglected, or, if not neglected, supplied at the
rate of one missionary to a million or half a million of people,
scattered in great districts!&nbsp; Let any one study the map of
India, and allow his eye to affect his heart.&nbsp; He will find
a district as large as Wales or Yorkshire, with a population
probably larger, without a single missionary.&nbsp; He may go on
and add to that another, and then another, and finally will
discover a long range of fertile, populous countries, as much
neglected as if they were districts in Japan.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
fearfully have we failed in the stewardship which God has given
us.</p>
<p>But let us remember who are really the parties that have been
thus deficient.&nbsp; In the acts of Government we may feel but
little personal responsibility, for, as private individuals, we
cannot control them.&nbsp; But it is not so with the stewardship
of the Church, for the deficiency has arisen there not from any
want of principle in the ruling body, but from want of interest
in the private individuals composing the flock.&nbsp; We have had
large and well-conducted Institutions doing their utmost: we have
had appeal after appeal to our <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>liberality, sometimes from the
bishops, sometimes from military officers, sometimes from
residents in the civil service, sometimes from the little band of
missionaries, and sometimes even from the heathen
themselves.&nbsp; They have appealed for money, and appealed for
men, and appealed for prayers.&nbsp; They have urged upon us the
awful necessities of millions of perishing heathen, and pressed
on our attention the noble opportunities and most solemn
responsibilities which we have received from God.&nbsp; The
neglect has been with ourselves.&nbsp; The responsibility cannot
be shifted upon others.&nbsp; We have not responded enough,
either in men or money.&nbsp; There have been plenty of young men
for the army and the civil service.&nbsp; There has been no
difficulty in obtaining chaplains, but few have volunteered for
Missions; and even of these few several have been deterred by
their parents&rsquo; unwillingness to part with them for such a
service.&nbsp; And so with funds: we have been content to give an
annual guinea, or perhaps much less, and then leave the whole
great work to others.&nbsp; There has been very little
self-denial for God.&nbsp; How little have any of us ever given
up for India&rsquo;s good!&nbsp; How small have been the
sacrifices which any of us have ever made for the evangelization
of those many millions!&nbsp; I cannot but think that God is now
awaking us by the rod to a sense of our responsibility.&nbsp; He
is awaking the north wind to rouse us from our
indifference.&nbsp; We have not listened sufficiently to
India&rsquo;s plea for help; so now He is shaking us from our
slumber, and I trust that the result may be that we may
&ldquo;hear the rod, and who hath appointed it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do
not believe that the stewardship is about to be taken from us,
but I believe, on the <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>contrary, that a new era is dawning
on India.&nbsp; I can imagine it possible that after this
experience of heathenism there will be any more deference paid to
its horrid idolatry by Government; and I pray to God that his
Church may rise an one man to the deep sense of its sacred trust;
that we may all be brought to a deeper personal knowledge of the
love of Christ, and each one act more conscientiously than he has
ever yet done, under the steady recollection of India&rsquo;s
claims and England&rsquo;s stewardship.</p>

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
